### Assignment Issues
I originally wanted three rows of three images each at the mobile and tablet sizes, so I created three divs, each with a "row" class, and wrapped it around three images. This gave me the layout I wanted at first, but it made it extremely difficult to make the images responsive at a desktop screen size. The 3x3 layout didn't fit above the above-the-fold section so it needed to be redone. I put all the images under one div with a "row" class and set column widths that way and it worked much better.  

### Outside Sources
[Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
This website was a great source for everything I needed for this assignment. I used a variety of its documentation to write my Bootstrap code.
